TextBox
=======

Simple textBox utility for Cocos2D-iPhone.

Uses CCLabelTTF to create textboxes where single words (or even letters) can be colored separately and images can be added in the middle of text. Complete with scaling and positioning for images. Each image can be positioned and scaled separately. Images are treated as inline elements and are flown along with the text just as words are.
